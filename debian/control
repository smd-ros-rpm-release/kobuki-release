Description: Description of the Kobuki model. Provides the model description of Kobuki for simulation and visualisation. The files in this package are parsed and used by a variety of other components. Most users will not interact directly with this package. WARNING: This package is disabled because it cannot be catkinized by now, as xacro dependency is not catkin still. In the interim we use a unary pre-catkin stack named kobuki_description.
