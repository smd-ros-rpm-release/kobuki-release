ros-indigo-kobuki-auto-docking (0.5.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Added extra url info on all packages.
  * adds params for kobuki_auto_docking launchers.
  * Changelogs at package level.
  * 32 bit alignment error. Fast fix: just remove the
    eigen-inheritor attribute, as it's not really needed. It was already
    commented in a previous commit; here I just cleanup and provide a
    description of the fix.
    But the fact is that something is wrong on ecl. We keep track on.
  * Fixed Eigenlib alignment error on 32 bit architectures.

ros-indigo-kobuki-auto-docking (0.4.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Add minimum speed parameters: with heavy payloads, at very low speeds, the robot can get stuck easily.
  * Remove motors enabling/disabling, as it can be confusing and it's not particularly useful.
